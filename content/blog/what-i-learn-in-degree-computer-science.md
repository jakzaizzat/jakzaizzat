### Don't depend on the education from College.
   
Most of the student depending on the education. Didn’t you realize that our education was behind the industrial? Especially in computer science. In my college, I need to learn C++ for the first year and Java for the second year. I need to build JSP Servlet project for my project, and the lecturer said the technology is outdated. Why the fuck, they teach us this kind of tech if they know this tech is outdated at outside. My suggestion is to keep learning. There are tons of free website out there to improve your skills such as treehouse, codeacademy, and youtube. 
   
### Please do all the project for each subject. 
  
This is the excellent advice for the student in this field. Most of the subject has their project. To master it quickly especially in programming, you need to **do**. It was a high learning curve but it well worth it. Some of the benefits you will get when you’re doing the project where you get the skills of doing the project. You may store the project into your GitHub account and state on your resume because you’re doing a **real project**. 

> Most of the company finds the employee with skill in git version control. If you have it, you have a significant advantage than others.

Second, your exam will get easier. Mostly there is a section in exam ask you to write a program or snippet. You have a full working program; it was a piece of cake. 
  
### Don't depend too much on the grade. 
  
I'm not telling you to fail in your grade and didn't study at all. Some of the students are working very hard to get a good grade but most important acquiring a skill is more important to me. This is what company are looking at when you are graduating later. **trust me** . I know your parent may ask you to get an excellent grade for your studies. Same as me. I study and try to get minimum 3.00 CGPA. I try to fulfill my parent hopes. 

> I told my son: you don’t need to be in the top three in your class, being in the middle is fine, so long as your grades aren’t too bad. Only this kind of person has enough free time to learn other skills. - **Jack Ma**

### Involve in many event to increase your social skills.
  
If I can go back in my college, this was I would do more. I'm not a person likes to involve with many events. I realized this when I was in the final year. I started to participate in programming competition and hackathon. If you are going to compare with self-taught developer or designer, you have access to large of people in your college. Keeps enlarge your network. Who knows, some of the people was your client in the future or someone who you will collaborate later. Gary Vaynerchuk has a great video.

### Get a way to get an income. 

You have a great skill to give value to other peoples. Find a freelance gigs or company looking for an intern. Learn from them, and keeps networking. Don't know how to find gigs? Start with your family and friends first. Don't focus too much on the money. Do it because you loved it.
