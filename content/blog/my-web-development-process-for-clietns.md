## Gathering Information

![Brainstorming](/image/20171029/brainstorming.jpg)
As a Web designer, I need to discuss with a client on what they want to achieve by doing a website. I have to learn more in deep what are they do, how they are making money and their target audience. Usually, this stuff will be done doing a face-to-face meeting, skype or through a phone call. This is the most critical step because if you do not understand what your client needs, the outcome will be not as expected.  I need to know the current sales before having a website with me so that I can measure the goals later.  

## Brainstorming

The headache part comes in. First of all, I need to make a research on others website what makes they outstanding and what element should I include. I list all of the components should contain in the website to achieve to clients goal. I design a workflow how the audience will do when they’re coming to the website. This is must to ensure the conversion rate converting well. 



## Wireframe

This process is where the imagination happens. Instead of imagining how the website looks like, I draw on my notebook how it looks in many possible solutions. This process needs to be done to reduce the time consumed in a design process later.

## Assets

Assets are things I need to build your website. Just like building a house, you need the bricks, roof, paint, wall and much more. For the website, I need a local server, graphics stuff (images, video or audio), website framework, and custom design. All of this need to identify because some of the items have their prices.  

## Design

All the equipment are ready, now what? Design an interface time! Wait. First of all, I need to design a style guide for the website. It’s an essential process. Need to define the typography, color and general element. 

Here is where a chemistry happens. I’m using Sketch to design the interface based on wireframe that I sketched previously. Combining creativity stuff with business-driven elements, are essential factor needs to implement in this process.  

## Development

Now, we have a great design, but it's not entirely functional. This is where the developer comes to the rescue. There are several options to build the website. Either static or dynamic website. If the client needs to update the website from time to time such as add event page, blog or food order, the dynamic website is the best choice. If not, static is the best. I’m using WordPress for the dynamic website. The website will be a custom WordPress development.  For sure, the website will be mobile responsive. Your website will suite on every device. I promise. 




## Testing

Designing done. Development was done. What’s next? Testing! 
In this process, the website will be tested to ensure it meets the objective and works perfectly. I’ll make sure that all function and setup will work correctly. For sure, I’m testing the website on every popular device to make sure it’s displaying correctly. 




## Revision 
I’ll upload the website to my server first to let the user interact and playing with the website. If any problem, I will write down the problem and fix it right away. In this stage, the client will comment on the website and gives feedback. Usually, I will provide three times revisions in the project. If it’s a small change, I don’t consider as revisions. 


## Final
Now let make it alive. I need to get access the hosting or server to transfer the website from the mine into the server. After the migration, I will give the login details to let the client manage it. For sure, I will guide on how to use it. Don’t worry if you didn’t have any experience dealing with this stuff. 

If the client doesn't have a domain and hosting, I will guide on how to purchase and setup it.
